For instance, a new \"Awards\" table and an \"AwardWinners\" association table linked to the \"Person\" table might be necessary, alongside fields to capture relevant contact information.\n\nIn summary, given the current database schema, texting any previous award winners would be problematic, as no relevant data is available within the defined structure.",
