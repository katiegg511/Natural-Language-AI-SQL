# McDonald Database

<!-- One+ sentence description or purpose of your database -->

Our database is designed to help McDonald's keep track of all the information related to their different Franchises, including information like employees, customers, food stock, and orders.

**GPT SQL Response**:

**Friendly Response**:

<!-- Sample question, SQL query, response that did not work (if you have one)  -->

## Question that it tripped up on
The SQL response was the correct way to answer the question, but then the friendly response invented a name for the franchise.

**Question**: Which franchise has the highest total revenue?

**GPT SQL Response**: ```
SELECT f.Id, SUM(o.Cost) AS TotalRevenue  
FROM Franchise f  
JOIN Orders o ON f.Id = o.FranchiseId  
GROUP BY f.Id  
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC  
LIMIT 1;  ```

**Friendly Response**: The franchise with the highest total revenue is Pok√©mon.

<!-- Describe somewhere which prompting strategies you tried and if you noticed a difference between them. (Note my post only does two of three - which is fine!).  -->

## Conclusion

We tried a meeting strategy, meaning we told chat there was an urgent meeting, in order to see if the urgency did anything. We then did that with zero_shot and one_shot. Chat was able to get all of them correct, with no discernable differences.
While the answers were correct, there were queries that got to the same answer but different ways. For example, to get the number of employees one used the NumEmployee column and another used the EmployeeId foreign key.

We also made a strategy to try and confuse it by having it be completely unrelated to SQL: "who made this chicken??? Was it you?" as a pre-prompt with zero_shot, and it still got everything right.
