5.  **Strategy**: Cross Domain Oneshot Confuse

    **Question**: Will we have a problem texting any of the previous award winners?

    **GPT SQL Response**: `Based on the provided database schema for the McDonald's database, it does not include any specific tables or fields related to awards or award winners. The schema focuses on addresses, persons, customers, franchises, employees, orders, menu items, food stocks, customer orders, and order items. There is no indication of any award-related data, such as award names, award dates, winners, or contact information for winners.\n\nConsequently, with the current structure of the McDonald's database, there is no direct way to track award winners or their contact information (like phone numbers or email addresses) for texting purposes.\n\nIf the aim is to track award winners or establish communication with them, additional tables or fields would need to be incorporated into the existing schema to record and organize such information. For instance, a new \"Awards\" table and an \"AwardWinners\" association table linked to the \"Person\" table might be necessary, alongside fields to capture relevant contact information.\n\nIn summary, given the current database schema, texting any previous award winners would be problematic, as no relevant data is available within the defined structure.`
